          <p class="lead blog-description">Tools I wouldn&#039;t want to do without.</p>
          <p class="blog-post-meta">March 22, 2016 by <a href="about.html">td</a></p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-8">
              <p>I use Macs as a personal workstation and I have a couple of them. At times I've used PC's, or Linux, or Unix variants. I always loved Unix for the command line and the shell, and the GUI for some things. Over the years I have grown used
                to having familiar tools around and where possible I've replaced them or moved on to other tools.</p>

              <p>One could argue what exactly the MacOS is, as its not BSD, its not Mach, but whatever... I can have bash or csh or ksh, and XWindow with layers of stuff bolted on or whatever this GUI really is. I have come to like my Mac.</p>

              <p>I also like linux but don&#039;t have a configuration available for Linux. I bought a new MacPro last winter. </p>

              <p> At the moment, this is home.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://calendar.sunrise.am/">Sunrise</a>
                  <p>A servicable Calendar replacement that currently supports Mac iCloud (through a mobile device), Google, but curiously not an Exchange server. </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a>
                  <p>Enrypted passoword keeper, that doesn&#039;t also store all your passwords on a server that someone inevitably hacks and therefore gets access to all your passwords. Integrates with Chrome on Mac and PC's, and there are IOS and Android
                    apps.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">Omnifocus</a>
                  <p>A good Todo list, accessible on my Android devices, on the web,on my phone, but not everywhere. Integration could be better.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-keep-notes-and-lis/hmjkmjkepdijhoojdojkdfohbdgmmhki?hl=en">Google Keep</a>
                  <p>Available as a Chrome plugin, and an app for IOS or Android, I use this for my shopping list, and use it to maintain lists of other stuff. It has a great UI and is simple to use -- for <em>just lists</em> that I want to carry around
                    with me.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/">DayOne</a>
                  <p>I journal at times, and this is an ok app for that. I use it as my own private Facebook, without 3 billion strangers also getting a look at my personal life through their browsers in the privacy of their own home.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://getconfide.com/">Confide</a>
                  <p>Instant read-once messaging, for contacting my many terrorist friends in congress and at the various broadcast networks.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://www.office.com/">Office Online</a>
                  <p>Yes, I use Office, mostly because I own it.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>
                  <p>Another essential app that I've used since the UI looked like a never ending roll of Charmin on a timeline. It is where I keep everything that isnt somewhere else, like software license codes, shell scripts... whatever. Well worth the
                    subscription.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html">Browsers</a>
                  <p>I use Chrome, Canary, Firefox and Safari. The rest I gave up on, though I do run IE just to see how it breaks things.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/download/">Git and Sourcetree</a>
                  <p>We all use these things. At a recent job I got reacquainted with the command line but not because I wanted to. Life at the top of the heap means you know git.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime</a>
                  <p>Not quite an IDE, but as good as an IDE for modern web development, and extendable if you actually write code. Lots of add ons, and well, just <em>cool</em>. I know there are other editors, but I have a history with the toolage.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/">Jetbrains</a>
                  <p>I also own all the JetBrains apps, and I use them occasionally for the odd feature that makes installing an antiquated Java RT justifiable.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="http://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a>
                  <p>Totally excellent FTP tool, makes FTP not even get in the way, drag and drop and sync to virtually any kind of FTP server, worth the price just for the typing it saves.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com/">Kaleidoscope</a>
                  <p>A really great file / folder comparison tool, for those situations when you&#039;re just not sure what changed, and its important.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a>
                  <p>A good tool for simple tasks, good to have around every once in awhile.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle">Omnigraffle</a>
                  <p>Its not Visio, but then again it&#039;s not Visio. An effective tool for workflows, UML, or wireframes, and not insanely expensive.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="http://www.pixelmator.com/mac/">Pixelmator</a>
                  <p>Its not Photoshop, but then again it&#039;s not Photoshop and I'm not a grapic artist. For what I occasionally need to do, its an effective tool and not insanely expensive.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/feedly.-read-more-know-more./id865500966?mt=12">Feedly</a>
                  <p>I still use RSS feeds to keep up to date on the WWW, maybe I'm old fashioned. Integration with Pocket, above, is good.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/mac/">Tweetbot</a>
                  <p>Yes, we all use twitter, though often when wonder why. Its like a visit to that crazy neighbor who has no unvoiced thoughts, but... A good app for it that is available on a variety of platforms.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://getpocket.com/mac/?a=mac">Pocket</a>
                  <p>This has been around for awhile and its great for keeping bookmarks for things I probably will read eventually but don&#039;t have time for right now that are ephemeral enough that I don&#039;t just add them to Evernote.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <p class="lead blog-description">I have a lot of other stuff this is the non visual list.</p>
                <li>
                  <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>
                  <p>Spotlight learned from Alfred, in version 2 its still better, and the workflows bridge the gap between the command line and the Mac.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="http://hyperdock.bahoom.com/">HyperDock</a>
                  <p>A little expensive just for thumbnails of open apps, but I like it.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://github.com/benjaminoakes/maid">Maid</a>
                  <p>A cleanup tool, works like <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel</a> but I have enough issues with Hazel that I&#039;d still rather write ruby, and I don&#039;t know ruby. A cool tool for an <em>expert</em>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://aptonic.com/">DropZone</a>
                  <p>Helps to keep your desktop organized.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://kapeli.com/dash">Dash</a>
                  <p>All that doc thats fit to download with snippets and stuff..</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="http://ccl.clozure.com/">Closure CL (lisp)</a>
                  <p>I love lisp. I do AI, lisp can make rules, save the rules, recompile the app. It learns.</p>
                </li>

              </ul>
              <p>So that&#039;s my list, at least its <em>today&#039;s</em> list.</p>
              <p>For a lot of things that there isn&#039;t an app for yet, I lean on <em>Alfred</em> and the huge library of workflows. Worst case for me is still just a bash script.</p>
